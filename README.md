# RK4-pendula
A Runge-Kutta 4th-order implementation in C++. The code was written a year ago and is quite shabby. I will clean it up when time permits.

If you're using MinGW, download the files as a `.zip` and open a terminal cmd in the folder. Run `g++ -o output main.cpp class.cpp` and `.\output.exe`.
