# RK4-pendula
A Runge-Kutta 4th-order implementation in C++ and Python. 

For C++, modify `initial.txt` and run the files. The code was written a year ago and is quite shabby. I will clean it up when time permits. If you're using MinGW, download the files as a `.zip` and open a terminal in the folder. Run `g++ -o output main.cpp class.cpp` and `.\output.exe`. 

For Python, added run `main.py` the code - it follows the same formalism as that described in the paper.
